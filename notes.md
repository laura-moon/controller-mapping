Attempts to edit the control map so that I have a key to hide HUD.  

- Using Kontrol as a base.
- Upload it to here: https://hawk.bar/SkyrimControlMapper/
- Remove the mapping for Quickload as I never use it.  Use this key compbo (Left Button + Back) to map F10 which is the keyboard hotkey I have already assigned to hide HUD (maybe using this mod?  https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62117 or something like it)

Idea being to use this for basic screenshots and Photo Mode for anything where I might want to use tfc etc.
